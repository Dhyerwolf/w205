In terms of what procedures have the highest variability between hospitals, I chose to focus on 
the procedures that are in the aggregate score variables in the hospital score. There variables are as follows:

1. acute myocardial infarction death rates (from outcomes)
2. heart failure death rates (from outcomes)
3. pneumonia death rates  (from outcomes)
4. early scheduled pregnancy rates (from clinical care)
5. flu vaccine rates (from clinical care)

AMI treatment in clinical care is not included because there are so few data points. Here is the standard 
deviation of each group divided by the average of each group in order to create a relative scale to 
compare how widely procedures vary (otherwise the flu vaccine rate would have the variation by default 
since it's percentage occurance is so much higher than the other categories). Also listed are the score averages
and standard deviations (Please note that I have rounded to 2 decimal points):

ami_death_ratio         heart_failure_ratio     pneumonia_ratio         pregnancy_care_ratio    flu_vacc_ratio
0.09		     	0.12      		0.13		 	1.91 		        0.14

ami_death_stdev		ami_death_avg		heart_failure_stdev	heart_failure_avg	pneumonia_stdev 
1.25		        14.06	        	1.46		        12.16		        2.1	  

pneumonia_avg   	pregnancy_care_stdev	pregnancy_care_avg      flu_vacc_stdev  	flu_vacc_avg
16.4	        	4.38		        2.29       		13.3       	 	91.79

Early scheduled pregnancy rates had the most variation, with the standard devation being significantly
bigger than the mean. Of course, the mean is very small at 0.02, but the range of pregnancy_care is much larger than any of the death
metrics. Flu_vaccine would have the second most variation (for better comparison, you could also subtract flu_vaccine
from 100, in which case the ratio would a little over 1.5. All the death metrics have very little deviation).
