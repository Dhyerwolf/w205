In terms of whether patient experience scores correlated with hospital quality or procedural variation (within procedures
per hospital), I decided to correlate patient experience to each the average score of infections, outcome and clinical care as well as
the correlation between patient experience and unaveraged infections, outcome and clinical care scores.
Here are the results (rounded to the nearest 2 decimals).

patient_overall_corr    patient_outcome_corr    patient_clinical_corr   patient_infections_corr
0.15		        -0.09			0.06		        0.17

There is very little correlation between patient experience and any of the other categories (including both the aggregate category and the
individual categories). In fact, outcome and patient experience were negatively correlated, which is unexpected (unless...the higher death 
rates meant that people who weren't happy with the hospital's care were more likely to be dead and therefore unable to give feedback. I will note
that the you include data from hospitals that had scores for 4 relevant categories, patient_outcome_corr is basically 0).
