In terms of what metrics describe the best hospitals, I think the Medicare for the most part had the right categories 
(https://www.medicare.gov/HospitalCompare/Data/total-performance-scores.html for more information). I believe that 
all the measures used to determine the final Medicare score are applicable to helping determine what hospital
provides the best care except for efficiency domain, which may not have any bearing on the patient’s experience. 

However, I would reweigh the balance between the four remaining groups:  clinical process, patient experience and outcome 
(3 measures regarding death rates following treatment) and safety (regarding rate of infections in the hospital). It makes sense that 
Medicare would put additional weight on outcome as a government entity, but as a consumer I think that I would put more weight on 
clinical care for a hospital because that covers a lot of routine visits. A hospital with bad clinical care would be a large
negative to a consumer. As such, I believe that the best hospital is the hospital with the highest average 
score of the following 4 questions: 

Outcomes: Will going to these hospitals potentially lead to more fatal outcomes?
Infections:  Is there more of chance of contracting another illness under this hospital’s auspices?
Patient Experience: Will going there be a miserable experience regardless of outcome?
Clinical Care Quality: Can the hospital deal well in covering a variety of other critical, but less deadly situations?

Effectively omitting any hospital with a score missing in any of these categories from the running, the following 10 hospitals had the 
best overall scores (rounded to the nearest 2 decimal digits):
